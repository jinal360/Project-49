  <p>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</p>
  <p>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.</p>
  <p>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.</p>
  <p>Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.</p>

  <p>Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim.</p>
  <p>Pandas go from pink to white and black (or brown).</p>
  <p>An adult can eat 12–38 kilos of bamboo per day!</p>
  <p>Pandas have carnivorous teeth, but they eat bamboo and fruit.</p>

  <p> Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</p>
  <p>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools</p>
  <p>Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.</p>
  <p> They improve lawns by digging tunnels that allow air into the soil. When they die, their rotting bodies put nitrogen into the soil.</p>

  <p>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.</p>
  <p>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</p>
  <p>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</p>
  <p>Pigeons and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years. The first recordings of this date back to Mesopotamis, modern Iraq, in 3000bc</p>
  <p>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</p>

  <p>The term bear-hug was first recorded in 1846.</p>
  <p>The Teddy Bears' Picnic song was originally called The Teddy Bear Two Step.</p>
  <p>The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.</p>
  <p>In 1902 in Germany, Steiff launched “Bear 55 PB”, the first toy bear with jointed arms and legs.</p>
